# Melcom Retail System - Full-Stack Application

Welcome to the **Melcom Retail Management System**! 
This project is a full-stack solution designed to manage retail operations for Melcom, one of Ghana's leading retail companies. It features a robust **Node.js + Express** backend connected to a **MySQL** database (hosted on **ScaleGrid**) and a dynamic **HTML/JavaScript** frontend interface.

## Project Structure Overview

```
â”œâ”€â”€ server.js                  # Express server setup (root)
â”œâ”€â”€ db.js                      # MySQL database pool and connection settings (root)
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ apiRoutes.js           # API routes handling CRUD operations for all entities
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dbUtils.js             # Utility for executing queries safely
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html             # Main frontend dashboard and UI (root/public)
â”œâ”€â”€ melcom-ssl-public-cert.cert # SSL certificate required for ScaleGrid connection
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                       # Environment variables (DB credentials, etc.)
```

## How to Setup and Run Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://your-repo-url.git
cd melcom-retail-system
```

### 2. Install Backend Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
DB_HOST=your-scalegrid-database-host
DB_USER=your-database-username
DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password
DB_NAME=Melcom
```

> **Note:** Default fallback credentials are already included in `db.js` for development.

### 4. Ensure SSL Certificate
Make sure `melcom-ssl-public-cert.cert` is present in the project root for secure database connections.

### 5. Start the Server
```bash
node server.js
```
or

```bash
npm start
```

The server will run at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Procedure / How It Works

1. **Frontend (`index.html`)** provides a clean admin dashboard to interact with different parts of the retail system (Categories, Products, Customers, Employees, Branches, etc.).
2. When users perform an action (e.g., Add Product, Edit Customer), **JavaScript functions** send **API calls** to the backend (`/api/...`).
3. The **Express server** (`server.js`) receives the API requests and routes them to the appropriate handler in `apiRoutes.js`.
4. **apiRoutes.js** uses **`dbUtils.js`** to safely interact with the **MySQL** database using prepared statements.
5. **db.js** defines a **MySQL2 pool** with SSL settings for secure and efficient database connections to ScaleGrid.
6. Responses (success or error) are sent back to the frontend, which updates the UI dynamically.

## About the Database (MySQL on ScaleGrid)

- **Database Name**: `Melcom`
- **Tables**: 
  - `ProductCategory`
  - `Product`
  - `Supplier`
  - `Employee`
  - `Branch`
  - `Customer`
  - `Order`
  - `Transaction`
  - `Inventory`
  - `Payroll`
  - `Department`

- **Relationships**:
  - Products belong to Categories and Suppliers.
  - Employees belong to Branches.
  - Orders link Customers and Products.
  - Transactions link Orders and Customers.
  - Payroll is tied to Employees.

- **Connection**:
  - The database is hosted on ScaleGrid with SSL enforced.
  - The Node.js server connects using `mysql2/promise` with connection pooling.

- **Security**:
  - SSL certificates are mandatory.
  - Environment variables manage sensitive data.

> **Important:** Always ensure the correct database permissions and IP whitelisting in ScaleGrid settings.

- **Product Management**: Full CRUD operations for products linked with categories and suppliers.
- **Employee & Branch Management**: Assign employees to branches; edit employee details dynamically.
- **Customer Management**: Track customer details, loyalty points, and total spend.
- **Order and Transaction Tracking**: Record orders and payments seamlessly.
- **Inventory Management**: Monitor and update stock levels.
- **Payroll System**: Manage employee salaries and contract dates.
- **Dashboard Metrics**: Visual reporting using Chart.js (Total Sales, Products, Transactions, Employees).

## Important Notes and Common Issues

### SSL Connection to ScaleGrid
- Connection to the MySQL database requires SSL.
- Use the provided `melcom-ssl-public-cert.cert` for secure connectivity.

### Database Connection Failures
If the server response is stuck in "pending":
- Check if the SSL certificate path is correct.
- Validate your ScaleGrid database credentials.
- Ensure your IP is whitelisted in the ScaleGrid dashboard.
- Add `connectTimeout` to avoid indefinite hanging.

### Employee Modal Branch Dropdown Issue
Ensure you use a dedicated function to load branch options into the employee form:
```javascript
loadBranchesForEmployeeDropdown();
```
instead of mistakenly using `loadBranches()` intended for displaying branch tables.

## Deployment Guidelines

- Ensure environment variables are properly configured in your hosting platform (e.g., Render, Railway, or AWS Elastic Beanstalk).
- Upload your SSL certificate as a file if required by the hosting environment.
- Make sure port settings (default 3000) are handled dynamically with `process.env.PORT`.
- Enable CORS policies as needed for frontend access.
